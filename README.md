This is my personal collection of scripts, documents, notes, and more, for the game [Bitburner](https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src), a programming-based incremental game that revolves around hacking and cyperpunk themes.

My current taskboard is publically available on my personal [Notion](https://faenre.notion.site/bf28dd63cc9f420caf4703ee04b8ace3?v=042dee35c118404984c90fe54e650d35&pvs=4). At time of writing, I'm migrating from JavaScript Native towards TypeScript.

The [[/src/]] directory has code inside. It's full of spoilers, if you care about such things. Beware!
