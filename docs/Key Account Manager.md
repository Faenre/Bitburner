The KAM role does everything in its power to maximize a client's success.

In game terms, the KAM:
- Runs on a standalone, purchased server with large amounts of RAM
- Handles one single client
- Uses as much of its memory as possible to maximize yield

When calculating the memory needs, beginning with a 30% growth factor, it calculates thread requirements for growth thresholds in 10% increments. The largest growth factor which can be supported by hack and weaken threads is accepted. Ideally, we want a minimum of 200% growth, but the higher we can scale, the better.
